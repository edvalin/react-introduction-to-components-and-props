# React - Introduction to Components and Props

## Setup 
Before we begin writing code, let's setup the project and install all necesarry packages.
Open a new Terminal window and do the following steps:

1. Go to `calab` directory:
    ```
    cd calab
    ```
2. Install npm packages:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the application:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    You should see the development server being started:
    [![Started](resources/started.png)]() 

    If you open the `Local` URL in a new browser tab, you should see the follwoing:
    [![Initial](resources/initial_screen.png)]()    


## Steps 

1. Create component called `Car`.
    -   Change direcory to `calab/src`.
    -   Create a new directory inside `src` called `componets`.
    -   Create a new file inside `componets` called `Car.jsx`.
    -   Add the following code to the `Car.jsx`:
        ```
        function Car() {
            return (
                <div>
                    <p>Volkswagen Golf</p>
                    <p>Year: 2015</p>
                    <p>Current Bid: Â£11000</p>
                </div>
            )
        }
        export default Car
        ```

2. Import newly created `Car.jsx` component to `App.js`.
    -   Open `App.js`.
    -   Replace text inside `<h1>` element to `Car Auction:`.
    -   Import newly created component `Car.jsx` to `App.jsx`. Above the app() function import `Car` from `'./components/Car'`
    -   Now that Car component is imported, let's use it. After the `<h1>` element, let's insert the car by creating `<Car/>`.
    -   Add another car `<Car/>`.

3. Add some Style the `Car.jsx`.
    - Create a new directory inside `componets` called `css`.
    - Create a new file inside `css` called `Car.css`.
    - Open `Car.css` and add the folowing css class:
      ```
      .background{
          background-color:  #343434;
      }
      ```
    - Open `Car.jsx` file and:
      - import `Car.css` file
      - add the CSS class called `background`
        ```
        <div className='background'>
        ```

4. Send props to `Car.jsx`:
    -  Open `App.jsx` and update `Car` elements with following props:
        ```
        <Car make='Audi' model='A3' year='2005' bid='8000'/>
        <Car make='Renault' model='Megane' year='2018' bid='18000'/>
        ```
    -   Open `Car.jsx` and use the props that were sent from `App.jsx`
        - Add `props` argument to the Car component.
        ```
        function Car(props)
        ```
        - In order to access `props`, let's use a JSX expression. Replace the following words with coresponding props:
        `Volkswagen` - `{props.make}`,
        `Golf` - `{props.model}`,
        `2015` - `{props.year}`,
        `11000` - `{props.bid}`.

If you followed the steps correctly you should see the following when you run your react application:
[![Result](resources/result.png)]()
